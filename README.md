## What to Install BEFORE!!! the lesson :cd:
Pretty much this time ;-)

:tv: [Watch this video before you start installing (30 MIN.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnJfGfm2g-0). It provides a lot of important information related to: Today's lecture, why we do what we do, and how to install the required software.

Follow this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v7pbEsQ24a4B07UjtFP3_hywqMF7URCRSr9EgpD2bUE/edit?usp=sharing), and install acording to your ambitions. If you go with the yellow/red track, you will have a perfect platform to continue with, if you plan for a future related to security.

__*I will assume you have installed the software BEFORE the lesson. We will not spend time with this in the class. This is 4. semester, so I expect you have heard about this "thing" called Google ;-)*__

## What to Read/Watch

- :tv: [Pen Testing Tips (Cartoon introduction, with a lot of important topics in short time (10 min) )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrjcnFTTDj8)
